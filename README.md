# Coffee Machine Program

This project is a simple console-based coffee machine program written in Python. It simulates the operation of a coffee machine by allowing users to choose from various drinks, checking resource availability, processing payments, and dispensing the chosen beverage.

## Features

1. **User Interaction**: The program prompts the user to choose from a list of drinks: espresso, latte, or cappuccino. The prompt reappears after each action is completed to serve the next customer.

2. **Turning Off**: Users can turn off the coffee machine by entering the secret word "off" to the prompt.

3. **Reporting**: Users can request a report of the current resource levels, including water, milk, coffee, and money.

4. **Resource Check**: The program checks if there are sufficient resources available to make the selected drink. If not, it notifies the user accordingly.

5. **Coin Processing**: If there are enough resources, the program prompts the user to insert coins and calculates the total value of the coins inserted.

6. **Transaction Check**: It verifies if the user has inserted enough money to purchase the selected drink. If not, it refunds the money. If the user inserts too much money, the machine offers change.

7. **Coffee Making**: If the transaction is successful and there are enough resources, the program deducts the ingredients required to make the drink and dispenses it to the user.

## Usage

To use the coffee machine program, simply run the Python script. Follow the prompts to select a drink, insert coins, and receive your beverage. You can also request a report or turn off the machine by entering the appropriate commands.
